## 🔭 About Me
I’m a **Data Enthusiast with 5+ years of experience** turning raw data into actionable insights through **scalable data platforms, ETL pipelines, and predictive models**. With a unique mix of **engineering skills and biomedical expertise**, I’ve delivered high-impact solutions in both **healthcare and commercial domains**.  

Currently, I’m pursuing my **M.S. in Analytics at Georgia Tech (graduating Dec 2025)**, where I work on projects in **data engineering, machine learning, and applied AI**.  

Previously, I served as **Sr. Manager of Data Science at Cofit Healthcare**, leading initiatives to integrate healthcare data, build cloud-based pipelines, and deploy machine learning solutions that directly improved patient outcomes and business performance.  

🚀 I’m passionate about designing **data-driven systems that scale**—from ETL pipelines to ML models—and I’m actively seeking **full-time opportunities in Data Engineering or Machine Learning Engineering starting 2026**.
