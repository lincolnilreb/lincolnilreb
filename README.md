# Hi, I'm Lincoln Lin 👋  

🎯 **Aspiring Data Engineer / Machine Learning Engineer**  

📍 Based in Georgia (open to opportunities in **GA, AZ, TX**)  | 🌐 [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/lincolnilreb) | 📫 [Email](mailto:lincolnilreb@gmail.com)



## 🔭 About Me
I’m a **Data Enthusiast with 5+ years of experience** turning raw data into actionable insights through **scalable data platforms, ETL pipelines, and predictive models**. With a unique mix of **engineering skills and biomedical expertise**, I’ve delivered high-impact solutions in both healthcare and commercial domains.  

Currently, I’m pursuing my **M.S. in Analytics at Georgia Tech (graduating Dec 2025)**, where I work on projects in **data engineering, machine learning, and applied AI**.  

Previously, I served as Sr. Manager of Data Science at Cofit Healthcare, leading initiatives to integrate healthcare data, build cloud-based pipelines, and deploy machine learning solutions that directly improved patient outcomes and business performance.  

🚀 I’m passionate about creating scalable data systems, from ETL pipelines to machine learning models. Now, I’m proactively seeking **full-time opportunities in Data Engineering / Machine Learning Engineering starting in 2026**. If you are looking for someone who love to challenge mission impossible., I’d love to connect.

✨ Thanks for visiting my profile!
